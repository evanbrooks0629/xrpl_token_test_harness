# An Introduction to Developing on the XRPL

Welcome! In this repository you will find a set of HTML and JS files that will allow you to follow along to my live demonstration.
It is recommended to download them onto your computer so you can follow along and expand upon the codebase.

To get this on your computer, open the terminal / command prompt and navigate to the directory you would like the project in.

Type in `git clone https://github.com/evanbrooks0629/xrpl_token_test_harness.git`. After this, move into the foldr created by typing `cd xrpl_token_test_harness`.

To open this folder in VSCode, simply type `code .` This will open VSCode in your project folder.

If you use another editor or the previous command isn't working, then open your preferred editor and navigate to the newly created project.

In your file window, when you click on any HTML file it will open in your local system. Using any `npm` command is not necessary since this only requires VanillaJS, which is already linked to each HTML file.

Follow along and watch which files I open so yuo can share my experience. 

Thank you for checking this out! I really appreciate it.
